# Stock Portfolio Generator

## Overview

This project was created in a team of 3 for the CFM 101 course at the University of Waterloo. It's for the team project that focuses on using Python to generate a stock portfolio using stocks that are given by a CSV file. The goal of our code is to build a high-risk growth portfolio using the stocks that are given.
